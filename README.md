# COVID-19-Prediction-ML-KNN
##  What is KNN ?
KNN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

# what's in code
In this code we have dataset which have riskfactor included with symtom of covid-19
we are asking user to input data and from that data we are calculating the Euclidean distance from dataset ,
the closed 7 case is then used to predict the chance of risk.

# O

This algorithm is easy to understand but is computationaly expensive hence, this algo should be avoided in large dataset
